# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (C++)

A simple console-based game written in C++ where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback for each guess — whether it's too high or too low — until the correct number is guessed.

## 💡 Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- Feedback on each guess (`Too high`, `Too low`)
- Tracks number of attempts
- Simple and beginner-friendly code

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard I/O (`iostream`)
- Random number generation (`cstdlib`, `ctime`)

## 🧾 How to Run

### 💻 Compile and Execute

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed like `g++`.

```bash
g++ -o guess_game guess_game.cpp
./guess_game
```

Or if you're using Windows Command Prompt:

```bash
g++ -o guess_game.exe guess_game.cpp
